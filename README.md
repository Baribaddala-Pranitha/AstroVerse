# 3D Space Exploration Project

This project is a 3D space exploration simulation that showcases a 3D galaxy, interactive stars, and a solar system. It allows users to explore the vast expanse of space, observe celestial objects, and interact with the stars and planets within a dynamic and immersive 3D environment.

## Features

- **3D Galaxy Visualization**: Navigate through a simulated galaxy with stars, nebulae, and other cosmic elements in a fully interactive 3D environment.
- **Star Interactions**: Observe and interact with stars, including their movements, gravitational forces, and light emissions.
- **Solar System**: Explore our solar system, view the planets, moons, and other space objects in 3D space.
- **Dynamic Lighting and Shadows**: Realistic lighting to simulate the effects of a star's light, including reflections, shadows, and day-night cycles on planets.
- **User Navigation**: Easy-to-use controls for zooming in and out, rotating the view, and flying through space.
- **Physics Simulation**: Simulate gravitational forces, orbital mechanics, and other physics principles to make the space interactions feel real.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: For rendering 3D graphics and handling the 3D space environment.
- **WebGL**: To enable high-performance graphics and rendering within web browsers.
- **JavaScript/HTML/CSS**: For front-end development and user interface.
- **Node.js**: For the backend server (if applicable).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/3d-space-exploration.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd 3d-space-exploration
    ```
3. Install dependencies (if any):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Run the project locally:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` (or the respective port specified).

## Usage

- **Keyboard Controls**: 
  - Use arrow keys or `WASD` to move around.
  - Use the mouse to look around and change your viewpoint.
  - Press `R` to reset the camera view.
  
- **Explore the Galaxy**: You can freely navigate through the galaxy, observing various celestial bodies like stars, nebulae, and galaxies.
  
- **Solar System View**: Click on any star or planet to zoom in and explore the solar system, view the planets orbiting their star, and learn about the various properties of each body.
  
- **Star Interaction**: Hover or click on any star to trigger interactions like observing its light emission, gravitational pull, and distance from nearby objects.
